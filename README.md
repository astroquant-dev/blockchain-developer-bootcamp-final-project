# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

The idea here is to have an NFT gallery where:

- Artists can mint their NFTs, by uploading an image
- The NFTs can be put up for sale
- The owners for each NFT are displayed on the gallery
- They can be borrowed by other galleries for display for a number of days, against a fixed daily fee
